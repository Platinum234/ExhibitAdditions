Their unique adaptation of webbed feet attribute towards their name, and they are primarily found in the swamps of Southern Africa. Despite this unique adaptation, the 40+ sized troops of Swamp Monkey primarily inhabit the trees and treetops of the rainforest. Like many other primate species, the swamp monkey practices social grooming, strengthening troop bonds by grooming each other. ",

The primary difference between the 2 species is physical appearance, they are generally larger in size and their tails are thinner and darker than the Black Wildebeest's recognisable white hair. These medium sized antelopes partake in one of the greatest  migrations on Earth, travelling 1000s of miles over plains, rivers, and sometimes certain lions pushed off cliffs by their adoptive brothers, in search of the rains",

Pronghorn can run  at speeds close to 60 miles an hour, and have the ability to maintain it for a decent amount of time. Interestingly, Pronghorn are abundant in North America, so much so that populations in are too high for the ecosystems! Currently, there are plans to repopulate the National Parks of which they live with predators such so that the population can return to a balanced level.",

On the whole, they are similar to most other african hoofstock behaviourally, however they can actually stand up to get to their food! The Gerenuk's diet consists of plant matter from trees and bushes, and the unique structures in their spine allow them to stand upright on their hind legs, to reach as high as 2m in the air!",

Pottos are actually nocturnal animals, therefore keeping these animals in captivity may be difficult. Additionally,  Pottos are uniquely adapted with strong jaws, to enable them to eat lumps of dried gum that are usually too tough for other tree dwellers.",

However, these guinea-pig imposters are both arboreal and loud, preferring to live at high elevations and are well known for their awful screams. It should also be recognised that despite their tiny size, they are the closest loving relative of the Elephant - the largest land mammal on the planet, even if they are 1/2250th the weight of their pachyderm cousins. These rodents are gradually becoming more common in captivity,  and luckily their population is stable.",
